Description:

This repo contains the data and code I (Sujeeth Jinesh) used for my CS 4641 class in Fall 2018. The data is contained in the data folder, which is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
The main python files I used are called `main_breast_cancer.py` for analyzing the breast cancer data, and `main_lung_cancer.py` for the lung cancer set.

Running code:

You must have python3 installed. Please install all the requirements in requirements.txt, which can be done with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
To run the algorithms you can now run `python main_breast_cancer.py` or `python main_lung_cancer.py`. If you would like to see the analysis I did, I left commented code.
The commented code can be uncommented and run to show the iterations I went through when selecting which model to use.

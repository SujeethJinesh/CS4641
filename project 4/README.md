To run the simulator, cd into RL_sim and run `java -jar rl_sim.jar`.

From here, select the algorithm you want to check out. Load the "7_medium_complex_multigoal.maze" file for my small maze, and "8_big.maze" for my big maze.

You can also look at the help folder to see which values to change for each algorithm and what they mean.
